==============

Useful scripts we use in the baliga lab

This repository will collect useful scripts we use for various data analysis and visualizations. These scripts will further be integrated into the tools we develop to create an integrated analysis environment.

It would be very useful if you include a short explanation of your script, what it does, what it requires etc., as well as some commenting to make it easier for others to understand.
